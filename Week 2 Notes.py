Generator Function:
- yield generator: differs from return in that it doesn't stop the function right where it is at
Can use functions as arguments
- lambda function: should only be used when the function you are trying to model is very simple
    - notation is "return lambda x,y:x+y"
- note that if have a function within a function, you can use the parameters of the parent function when defining the
lower function but you cannot modify the parameters


OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:
- everything is made up of parts
- to try and think of all the parts all the time would lead to analysis paralysis
- object oriented programming works to make the details work behind the scenes and so that is isn't something that the
user has to think about; so creates a user interface (abstraction), something that is organized so that we can
understand what is going on (organization)
    - functions are bad at organizing data
    - dictionaries are good at organizing data but bad at methods
    - we want to be able to combine the strengths of both functions and dictionaries
    - we do this through classes!!
        (so classes combine the data structure perks of dictionaries and the method perks of functions)
- (Problem Solving Tips from Butner):
    * step away from computer
    * do some examples by hand
    * think about those steps that you used to solve the problem
    * write the steps down
    * make corrections
    * translate to code
    * test through unit tests
